# vis3p 

## About
vis3p is part of a research project in nonlinear mathematical optimization. vis3p computes and draws valid inequalities for sets that are given by polynomial constraints, using a method known as sos programming. As of now, drawing is limited to two dimensions. It is an implementation of the ideas in Chapter 2 in my [PhD thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-1735-0000-0023-3F9C-9) and the examples provided here will be used in an upcoming publication (joint work with [Prof. Dr. Anita Sch√∂bel](https://optimierung.math.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?section=members&subsection=schoebel&lang=de)).

## Example

The output may look like the following.
